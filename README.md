# Untrimmed Slayer Cape Helper

- Shows the amount of slayer-only experience required to obtain 99 Slayer **at the same time** as 99 Hitpoints, factoring in standard combat experience.
  > The player can use this indicator as a guide but will need to adjust their playstyle accordingly to obtain 99 Slayer **before** 99 Hitpoints. The goal is to keep this indicator in the negative (green). To achieve this the player should prioritise; cannoning tasks, boss tasks (e.g. Tortured demons, Jad/Zuk, Superiors), and utilizing thralls on tasks.
- Shows the amount of expected Hitpoints XP after obtaining 99 Slayer from standard combat.
